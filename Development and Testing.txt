Development and Testing:

The following challenges were faced during development and for testing:-

Will the data be proper sensed from the device?
Will the data be written as we want in the file?
How to write the data to generate graphs?
Is the Start button freezing?
How to resolve freezing?
(For this freezing issue I extensively researched about it and 
 tried to apply multi-threading but was not able to get a 
 perfect execution. So I created a while loop to loop for specific time
 and removed the 'Stop' button.)

How to generate graphs?
Will matplotlib generate graphs in tkinter?
Why the canvas not displaying graphs?
Is the data read proper from selected file to display the 
graph on the canvas?
