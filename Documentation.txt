The programs has following widgets:


The 'Start Reading' Button:- 

On clicking this button, the programs attempts on sensing the 
humidity and temperature 
from the raspberry pi device. 
At the same tiem it stores every sensed value in a list.

The time is also read at each specific instance and written in a list.

Then all the values are written in the file, making separate
files for temperature and humidity 
for the purpose of generating 
graph separately for both of them.

After the task is done a label is displayed as

'The temperature and humidity reading finished and written'.



The 'Select File for Graphical Report' Label:-

This is just a label to tell the user to select file to generate graph



The 'entry box':-

This is to display the file selected.



The 'Browse' button:-

This button browses the current directory for file to be selected.



The 'Generate Graph':-
On clicking this button, the data from file is read from second 
line
 and then stored in a list.
The list is then given to the 'Figure' object 
to generate the graph,
in our case a scatter graph with Time as x axis and 
Temp/Humid as y-axis. 
All these is displayed on the canvas of the tkinter window

through 'FigureCanvasTkAgg'.
